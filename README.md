# Firefox 3 Theme

This is a theme for Firefox Quantum PHOTON (57 to 88) to look like Firefox 3. 

Firefox 88.0.1 can be downloaded at https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/88.0.1/

This borrows from an old version of Aris-t2/CustomCSSForFX

# Questions and Answers (Q&A)

*But I don't want the Menu Bar/Bookmarks Toolbar!*
Those are necessary prerequisites for this theme.

*But Firefox 88 doesn't load websites nowadays!*
In about:config, create a string titled 'general.useragent.override' and set its value to the newest Firefox useragent.

*Why doesn't this work on Firefox 89+?*
Firefox 89 completely changed the base UI. As a result, this theme is broken.

*Why doesn't the YouTube theme work?*
Things change over time. I will try to keep the Youtube theme updated.

*Youtube Redux isn't working/is broken!*
YouTube Redux does not get many updates nowadays. Things might be broken. I cannot control these as I do not develop the extension.
